# E-Commerce-Back-End

## Description

In this project, I created a back end application, using express.js and sequelize, that would allow an e-commerce website to track data for different products. The user would be able to add, delete, update, and view all products. I used Insomnia to test all of the routes that would be used for the site.

## Installation

In order for this application to work you will need the node environment and MySql installed on your computer. Adequate instructions for downloading the node environment can be found at nodejs.org. Instructions for downloading MySql can be found at mysql.com. To install all dependencies for this program, start by opening the index.js file in an integrated terminal and run "npm install". The user will also need Insomnia, or a similar application to test the routes.

## Usage
1. Make sure all dependencies are installed by running npm install.
2. Source the database by opening the db folder in an integrated terminal, and running mysql -u root -p. You'll need to create a .env file that holds your database name, password and user.
